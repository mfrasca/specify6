Detailed here are the version numbers of all libraries included in this
directory.  The listings that are indented are for libraries that are runtime
dependencies of the un-indented listing just above them.  Their version numbers
are not listed since they are 'tied' to the version of the parent library.
Other versions can be retrieved from their repective websites, but runtime
compatibility with the 'parent' libraries is not guaranteed.
