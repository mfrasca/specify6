Taxon synonyms in Specify 5 are stored differently than the way they are
handled in Specify 6.  During the conversion of Specify 5 databases to Specify
6, some taxon names placed in synonymy in Specify 5 could not be positioned
properly in the Specify 6 Taxon Tree. This Specify 6 Taxon Synonym Cleanup tool
addresses that issue.  The cleanup operations this tool performs will have no
effect on collection databases created for the first time in Specify 6, or on
Specify 6 databases converted from other types of legacy systems. If your
collection&#39s data were not converted from Specify 5 to 6, this cleanup tool and
report will produce no useful information and will not change your Specify 6
database.  If that is the case, stop reading now, move on, there is nothing for
you here.  For Specify 6 sites which were converted from Specify 5, visit the
Specify Project web site (www.specifysoftware.org) and download the help
document entitled: &#34Specify 6 Synonym Cleanup Tool&#34. Before running this tool
on your database, read how its cleanup functions may change the location of
some synonym entries in your Taxon Tree.  Running just the cleanup report may
take a few minutes; it will summarize the changes the cleanup tool would
make.
