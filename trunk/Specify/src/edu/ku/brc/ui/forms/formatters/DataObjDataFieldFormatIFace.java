/**
 * This interface represents a formatter for a data object. There are two types of formatters: Direct and indirect.<br>
 * A "direct" formatter implicitly knows how to format the data object being passed in. This enables us to support formatting
 * that is far more complex than anything we can describe in the XML. It also enables the internal formatter to 'key' off 
 * other data members contained in the data object.<br>
 * <br>
 * Indirect formatters use the XML description to perform a recursive formatting.<br>
 * <br>
 * Note: Formatters are 'switchable' meaning they can identify a field in the data object to determine which format they should
 * use. There can be any number of formats for switching, but usually it is just a couple.
