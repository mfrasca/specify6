<td><h2>About Trees in Specify</h2></td></tr>
</table>

<p>Specify 6 stores various table data in heirarchical tree format. These include Taxon, Geography, Storage, Chronostratigraphy and Lithostratigraphy. These tables are also included in the form system, but the tree offers a more broad, visual glimpse of the data. Data can be edited and entered using both the form and tree system.</p>
<p>Each of these trees can be built in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Manually by adding  one record at a time. This will be necessary for the Storage tree, as it is unique to each Institution and Collection.</li>
  <br />
  <li>Dynamically from an existing user database. This may include a conversion from Specify 5 or other type of database, which the Specify team can help with, or a data import through the WorkBench. </li>
  <br />
  <li>Dynamically by either downloading and importing an authority file from an authority source or taking advantage of a converted file from the Specify team. </li>

</ul>
<p>Specify has  converted Taxon authority files  from the Catalog of Life. These  are available as predefined, discipline specific files that can either be preloaded into a blank database for those users wishing to start from scratch or used to augment existing data by sending the Specify team your database for inclusion of this data.</p>
<p>Specify has also converted Geographic authority files from Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names and ships with data for Continent, Country, and States throughout the world. County data  for the United States is also included.</p>
<p>The Chronostratigraphy Tree includes authority files for five ranks in the North American System as converted from the Geological Society of America. </p>
<p>The Lithostratigraphy Tree includes four predefined ranks only. </p>
<p>Although it is possible to enter trees in their entirety from within Specify 6, the Specify project does not recommend building  large trees  manually. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Specify Tree Terminology</h3>
<p>The various trees show  relationships in a hierarchical structure. All hierarchies are referred to as <strong>ranks</strong>. All nodes immediately under a rank are referred to as <strong>children</strong>. Any node with a child is referred to as a <strong>parent</strong>.</p>
<p>Ranks are shown in columns on the tree.<em><strong> </strong></em>Tree column colors  can be set in <em>Preferences &gt; Tree</em>. See also <em><a href="../Prefs/Prefs.html">Preferences</a></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Using Trees</h3>
<p>Click <em><img src="../../images/Tree-32x32.png" width="20" height="20" /> Trees </em>on the Task Bar,  to open the Tree tool. Trees are group by task on the Sidebar.</p>
<p><strong>Edit Trees</strong> lists the trees available for the collection. Click a tree to open it in the Workspace.</p>
<p><strong>Edit Tree Definitions</strong> lists the definitions for each tree. This tool defines the ranks available in a  Tree as well as with how these ranks are enforced in data entry and used in aggregating the full name. <em> </em>Before adding nodes to an empty tree, the Tree Definition must be completed. </p>
<p><strong>Unlock a Tree</strong> is only available through permissions and is not  available to all users. </p>
<p>Only one user may edit  a tree, tree definition or the related data entry form at the same time. Simultaneous editing of a tree, tree definition or data form is also not permitted by a single user. Trees and forms will still be available for viewing, searching or querying. In order for a second user to use the tree or form, the first user must close the affected tab. </p>
<p>When a tree definition is open and the same user opens a tree the tree definition does not need to be closed, the tree will display in the  tree sub pane.</p>
<p>In the event that a tree becomes locked and the user of that tree can not be located, (which may occur due to improper shutdowns of the application), the tree can be unlocked by clicking it under this heading<em></em>.</p>

<h3><a name="drag_drop">Dragging and Dropping</a></h3>
<p>Nodes can be dragged and dropped within the tree module to move or synonymize nodes. When the screen is split, nodes can be dragged and dropped within the same screen or into the opposite screen. A highlight box will appear around any nodes that can accept the node being dragged. Once the node is dropped onto the accepting node a dialog will appear allowing the user to:</p>
<p><strong>Reparent</strong> a node (and its children) to a new parent. Enforced ranks may not be skipped. This option is only available when dragging BETWEEN ranks.</p>
<p><strong>Synonymize</strong> the node.   To undo a synonymy right-click on the node and choose <em>Undo Synonymy</em> in the context menu. Synonyms are differentiated from non-synonyms by their text color. Synonym text color can be set in <em><a href="trees.html">Preferences</a></em>. Synonyms  also show as a tool tip on the node. This option is only available when dragging  WITHIN a rank.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Synonymys created in the Taxon tree are captured in the Active Taxon field on the Determinations form.</p>
<p>Select <strong>Cancel</strong> on the dialog to place the node back in its original position.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Collection Object Counts</h3>
<p>Counts of collection objects associated with each node can be enabled for all trees. This feature requires data processing and therefore is not enabled by default. Enable Collection Object Counts  on a tree by choosing <em>Preferences &gt; Tree</em>. See also <em><a href="trees.html">Preferences</a></em></p>
<p>Counts are displayed next to the Node as two numbers (<strong>X</strong>,<strong>Y</strong>):</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>X</strong> represents the number of Collection Objects for the Node only. </li>
  <li><strong>Y</strong> represents the number of Collection Objects for the Rank and all nodes beneath it. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Find</h3>
<p>Click Cntl+F to open the Find tool (which opens under the Tree Subpane). This is particularly useful to expand the tree to the end Nodes. The arrow icons  refer to the view that is appropriate for the search. </p>

  </tr>
</table>
<p>If only one screen is open, it is best to choose <img src="../../images/up.png" alt="up" width="16" height="16" />(top view). </p>
<p>Find a node by typing a single term into the Find text box and clicking the <em>Find</em> button. Full taxon names are not accepted. </p>
<p>Find allows either a %, (percent sign), or *, (asterisk), to be used. For instance; Joh% will find Johnson in a tree.</p>
<p>Click the Next button to find the next usage of the word in the tree. For instance; Johnson may be used as the name of a county in different states. This would find the next 'Johnson' in the Geography tree.</p>
