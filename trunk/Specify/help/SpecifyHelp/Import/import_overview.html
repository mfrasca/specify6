<p>Both forms and reports can be exported and imported into Specify using this module. Forms can be exported, changed in XML and then reimported back into Specify. Reports can be exported then imported back into Specify at a different level, in this way reports can be shared within an institution. This ability would also allow both forms and reports to be consistent within an entire community of collectors. </p>
<p>User Defined <a href="../PickList/Pick_List.html">Pick Lists</a> and <a href="../SchemaConfig/WebLinks.html">Web Links </a>can be created in Specify but will only be added on a form by exporting the form as a form set and adding them to the form by editing the XML file. The edited form will then need to be reimported back into Specify. </p>
