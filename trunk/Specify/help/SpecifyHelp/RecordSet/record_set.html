<h2><strong>Record Sets </strong></h2>
<p>Simple Search and Query both have the ability to return groups of records. These can be named and saved as Record Sets. Saved Record Sets are listed on the Sidebar and can be dragged and dropped onto other items on the Sidebar. </p>
<p>Record Sets will appear in the Sidebar of the following tools:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data Entry</li>
  <li>Interactions</li>
  <li>Reports</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Drag the Record Set upward toward the  list of actions (Form Type or Report). A green outline will appear around the action  that can accept the data, indicating where to drop the Data Set. </p>
<p>Drop a Record Set onto another Record Set to merge them. Any duplicates will be automatically removed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Right-button-click on a Records Set to perform the following functions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rename</li>
  <li>Delete</li>
  <li>View; this opens a results window listing the contents of the Record Set and allowing individual records to be deleted. </li>
</ul>
