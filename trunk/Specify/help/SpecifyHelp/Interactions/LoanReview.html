This help from the dialog that pops up when creating a loan where it lists all the available items that can be loan.

This Dialog shows ALL the loans that the LoanPreparatin on the previous dialog is "attached" to. Some confusion 
stems from that it shows the entire set of Loan and all the Loan Preparations NOT just the one next to the "i" button that was pressed.
