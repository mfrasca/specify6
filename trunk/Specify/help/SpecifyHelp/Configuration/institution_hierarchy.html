<h2><a name="institution_levels" id="institution_levels"></a>Adding Institutional Levels</h2>
<p> The Specify data management levels mimic  the common levels of hierarchy within institutions. Access to information and Specify tools are then set at the various levels both within the application itself and through the User Permissions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Institution</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Division</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Discipline</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Collection</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Users</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  </ul>
<p>The   Divisions, Disciplines and Collections for each institution are added in the System Configuration module of Specify; <em>System &gt; Collection Setup &gt; Configuration</em>. All tabs need to be closed before opening the Configuration. This tool is available to users in the Manager group only.</p>
<p>Collections information in Specify 6 databases is also organized at these institution levels to meet requirements for data integrity and data sharing among collections. Some data elements are commonly shared among all collections within an institution, while others are shared only among collections in the same taxonomic discipline, i.e. &quot;at the Discipline level&quot; in Specify. Before creating the institution levels it is imperative that an administrator also understand the data that is held at each level to create the correct setup. A white paper for this is found at ...</p>
<p>When starting with an empty database the Division levels should be added first, then Discipline and then Collection. Each  is added at the level above it. For instance, Divisions are added within the Institution form. </p>
<p>Editing  a Division and Discipline is accomplished on the Discipline form. A Collection can be edited either on the Discipline form or Collection form.</p>
<h4><strong><a name="add_division" id="add_division"></a>Add  Divisions</strong></h4>
<p>Click the <img src="../../images/institution_16.png" width="16" height="16" /> <em>Institution</em> button on the Side Bar to edit the Institution or add a Division.</p>
<p>At least one Division should appear in the Division sub form. </p>
<p>Click the <img src="../../images/add.png" width="16" height="16" /> (add) button to add a Division.</p>
<p><strong>Name</strong> is the only required field and is used in any lists of Divisions within Specify as well as in the Institution Hierarchy.</p>
<p><strong>Alt Name</strong> provides another field for name. This is often useful when a particular Division has changed names or uses a longer name than is applicable to the Hierarchy list. </p>
<p><strong>URI</strong> stands for Uniform Resource Identifier and refers to a  resource on the internet (a Division web site).</p>
<p><strong>Is Accession Bound</strong> tells Specify that this Division does not share Accessions within the institution  and will use its own accession table and Accession Number format.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><a name="add_discipline" id="add_discipline"></a> Add Disciplines</strong></h4>
<p>Click the <img src="../../images/division_16.png" width="16" height="16" /> <em>Division</em> button on the Side Bar to edit a Division or add a Discipline.</p>
<p>The Division form includes the information entered when the Discipline was added. The new Discipline will be added in the Division that is currently displayed in the Workspace. Use the navigation control at the bottom of the window to step to the  Division that will include the new Discipline. </p>
<p><img src="../../images/next_bar.png" width="174" height="25" /></p>
<p>In the Discipline sub form click the <img src="../../images/add.png" width="16" height="16" /> (add) button to add a Discipline.</p>
<p>A dialog listing all available Discipline types will display. Choose a discipline type from the list. The chosen type will appear in the Type field. This name is used by the database in Specify.</p>
<p><strong>Data Type</strong> indicates that the data base is for biological collections and is not editable.</p>
<p><strong>Name</strong> allows the Discipline to be named something unique rather than using the chosen Discipline type. This name will display in any Discipline lists within Specify as well as in the Institution Hierarchy.</p>
<p>A Collections sub form displays under Disciplines on this form. It is to view Collection data only, Collections can not be added or edited from the Division form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a name="add_collection" id="add_collection"></a>Add Collections</strong></p>
<p> Click the <img src="../../images/discipline_16.png" width="16" height="16" /> <em>Discipline</em> button on the Side Bar to edit a Discipline or add a Collection.</p>
<p>The Discipline information will appear at the top of the form with a Collections sub form underneath. The new Collection will be added in the Discipline that is currently displayed in the Workspace. Use the navigation control at the bottom of the window to step to the  desired Discipline before adding the new Collection.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/next_bar.png" width="174" height="25" /></p>
<p>Click the <img src="../../images/add.png" width="16" height="16" />(add) button to add a Collection. </p>
<p><a name="catalog_number" id="catalog_number"></a>A Numbering Scheme dialog will appear. This refers to the Catalog Number. </p>
<p>Specify requires a unique catalog number for each specimen. It does not matter what catalog number a collection uses for a specimen as long as the number is unique. Many museums routinely assign catalog numbers to incoming specimens. Those institutions can create a format for their catalog numbers determined through the museum's accepted cataloging practices. </p>
<p>Some institutions do not use catalog numbers. Many herbaria, for example, have never maintained a printed catalog. Those institutions may question the need to assign each specimen a catalog number in Specify. But nothing in the Specify environment requires changes to the existing methods for organizing and storing specimens. For example, you can still store sheets by genus and species in phylogenetic or alphabetical order if that is your established procedure. If you do not use catalog numbers and do not want to assign a number just for Specify, you can configure Specify to automatically assign a catalog number to each new specimen numbers for all practical purposes. </p>
<p>To accept a numbering scheme simply click on the correct one in the list (or use the down-arrow key). </p>
<p>To add a numbering scheme -- Work in Progress!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Collection Form</u></p>
<p>The <strong>Collection Name</strong> will be used on any Specify Collection lists as well as in the Institution Hierarchy. </p>
<p><strong>Add Collecting Event Automatically</strong> creates a new, unique Collecting Event record for each Collection Object. This is used for ....</p>
<p><strong>ABCD Schema Fields</strong> is a sub form for adding this information to the Collection.</p>
