<h2>Configuration Overview</h2>
<p>The Configuration tool within Specify is found by clicking<em> Configuration at System &gt; System Setup &gt; Configuration</em>. It offers many tools for setting up Specify for your specific institution as well as individual collections within the institution. The  Configuration tool (and menu) is only available to Administrators. </p>
<h4>Side Bar Global Data </h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>The side bar offers Institution, Division, Discipline and Collection forms for adding these levels within Specify. Users that have run the Specify Setup Wizard  have their Institution as well as one Division, Discipline and Collection already configured within Specify. If more of any of these Institutional levels are required within Specify they need to be added before any data is entered. Directions for performing these tasks can be found at <a href="../Configuration/institution_hierarchy.html">Adding Collections, Disciplines and Divisions</a>.</p>

<h4>Side Bar Discipline Data</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><u>Preparation Types</u> are Pick Lists that have an additional function; they determine if specimens with specific preparations can be loaned. For this reason they have a form for editing purposes. Simply click Preparation Type on the side bar to bring up the form. For additional information please refer to <a href="../Configuration/prep_type.html">Editing the Preparation Type</a>.</p>
  <p><u>Pick Lists</u> that are included on the default Specify forms are referred to as 'System Pick Lists' and can be edited for individual Disciplines within Specify. This is accomplished using the Pick List Editor. System Pick Lists can also be imported and exported using additional buttons on the side bar. Please refer to <a href="../Picklist/system_picklist.html">Editing System Pick Lists</a> for additional information.</p>
  <p><u><a name="block_logins" id="block_logins"></a>Block Logins</u> will block all other users from logging in to Specify. This feature is only available to a Specify Administrator. While the logins are blocked the administrator that blocked the logins can still login and use Specify in a normal capacity. This feature is often helpful when maintenance tasks for the Specify database are being performed.</p>
