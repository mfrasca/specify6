    <h2>Configuration Overview</h2>
    <p>The Configuration tool within Specify is found by clicking<em>
        Configuration at System &gt; System Setup &gt; Configuration</em>.
      It offers many tools for setting up Specify for your specific
      institution as well as individual collections within the
      institution. The Configuration tool (and menu) is only available
      to Administrators. </p>
    <h4>Side Bar Global Data </h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The side bar offers Institution, Division, Discipline and
        Collection forms for adding these levels within Specify. Users
        that have run the Specify Setup Wizard have their Institution as
        well as one Division, Discipline and Collection already
        configured within Specify. If more of any of these Institutional
        levels are required within Specify they need to be added before
        any data is entered. Directions for performing these tasks can
        be found at <a
          href="../Configuration/institution_hierarchy.html">Adding
          Collections, Disciplines and Divisions</a>.</p>

    <h4>Side Bar Discipline Data</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p><u>Preparation Types</u> are Pick Lists that have an additional
        function; they determine if specimens with specific preparations
        can be loaned. For this reason they have a form for editing
        purposes. Simply click Preparation Type on the side bar to bring
        up the form. For additional information please refer to <a
          href="../Configuration/prep_type.html">Editing the Preparation
          Type</a>.</p>
      <p><u>Pick Lists</u> that are included on the default Specify
        forms are referred to as 'System Pick Lists' and can be edited
        for individual Disciplines within Specify. This is accomplished
        using the Pick List Editor. System Pick Lists can also be
        imported and exported using additional buttons on the side bar.
        Please refer to <a href="../Picklist/system_picklist.html">Editing





          System Pick Lists</a> for additional information.<br>

        released with Specify 6.5, is a specially designed function for
        Specify 6 databases which have been created from data
        conversions from Specify 5.&nbsp; The taxon synonym cleanup
        operations the tool performs will not affect collection
        databases created for the first time in Specify 6, nor on
        Specify 6 databases converted from other legacy systems.
        &nbsp;For Specify 6 databases converted from Specify 5, visit

      <p><u><a name="block_logins" id="block_logins"></a>Block Logins</u>
        will block all other users from logging in to Specify. This
        feature is only available to a Specify Administrator. While the
        logins are blocked the administrator that blocked the logins can
        still login and use Specify in a normal capacity. This feature
        is often helpful when maintenance tasks for the Specify database
        are being performed.</p>

      <p align="left"><a name="activate_subform" id="activate_subform"></a><u>Activate Subform</u> allows a Collection Object
        Attribute, Preparation and/or Determination record to be
        automatically created at the same time a new Collection Object
        is created. If a form has been edited to include a default value
        the new record will be created and include the default value.
        For instance, if a collection uses only one Preparation and does
        not wish to create a new Preparation each time a new Collection
        Object is added to their collection, the Preparation form can be
        edited to include a default value and when a new Collection
