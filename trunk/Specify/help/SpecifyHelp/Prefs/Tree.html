Tree Preferences<br>
This panel is used to configure the various tree within Specify.
<p>
Restore Expansion State will expand (show the nodes) of a given tree to the previous "expanded" state when it was last opened. 
If it is turned off the tree will first be shown in a collapsed state.
</p>
<p>
Each tree can have it's own alternating colors and the level the collection counts start can also be set. 
Note that the higher node you select in a tree for the counts will impact performance. For example, if the Taxon counts where set to 'Kingdom' then Specify must calculate
all the collection counts from that point in the tree on down.
