<p>Example files and images are included with the WorkBench and can be imported for testing the various functions of the WorkBench. These are located in the Examples/Data Sets directory. 
Each file includes several columns representing  different discipline specific fields. Each file also includes columns that do not map in the Mapping editor 
to illustrates the operation of the mapping function. The resulting Data Sets from these files will exhibit different functionality
