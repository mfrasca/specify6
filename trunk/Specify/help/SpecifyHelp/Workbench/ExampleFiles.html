<p>Example files and images are included with the WorkBench and can be imported for testing the various functions of the WorkBench. These are located in the Examples/Data Sets directory. Each file has a number of columns representing various different discipline specific fields. In each data set there are a couple of fields that do not map in the Mapping editor to illustrate the operation of this function while the various data sets exhibit different functionality in the BioGeomancer(<img src="../images/biogeomancer16x16.png" alt="biogeo" width="16" height="16" />) and Google Earth (<img src="../images/GoogleEarth16x16.png" alt="ge" width="16" height="16" /> ) tools. These are listed below:</p>
