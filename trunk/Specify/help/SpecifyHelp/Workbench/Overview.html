<H2>Welcome to the Specify 6 WorkBench</H2>
<hr>
<p>The Specify 6 team spoke with many Collection Managers while designing the new Specify 6. While conducting interviews and reading evaluations it became clear that the community needed a separate tool for working with data <em>before</em> it was cataloged into Specify. Some collections require such a tool for entering legacy data, others want a small, standalone tool to take in  the field and still others need to manipulate their  data before cataloging it in Specify without having to  enter it into a spreadsheet first, and then re-enter it into Specify. </p>
<p>The WorkBench was created to meet these specific needs within the community. As a pre-catalog data manipulation component of Specify 6, it offers the following features: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Import from CSV or MS Excel files</li>
  <li>Link an image to a record</li>
  <li>Create labels and reports</li>
  <li>View and edit in either a grid or form view </li>
  <li>Visualize georeferenced object information on a map or in Google Earth </li>
  <li>Convert and standardize Latitude and Longitude formats</li>
  <li>Georeference</li>
</ul>
<h3><u>Introducing Data Sets</u></h3>
<p>Data is entered, edited, organized and stored in a  Data Set. The WorkBench offers many features for manipulating the data within Data Sets before it is cataloged into Specify 6. </p>
<p>One of the most important of these features is the organization of the data into Specify fields. This is not only necessary for other features in the WorkBench to function correctly, but also ensures that the data will upload correctly into Specify 6. The column headings for new Data Sets are chosen from a list of Specify fields corresponding to the Specify data model. The column headings can  be renamed, but will still maintain a link to the original Specify field. These links are referred to as 'maps'. These maps can also be edited. </p>
<p>When data is imported from a CSV or MS Excel file the WorkBench will read the existing column headings and map them to Specify fields with a built-in 'automapper'. Any column headings that the WorkBench does not recognize and 'automap' can be manually mapped and edited. </p>
<p>Data Sets can be edited as either a grid or a form. </p>
<p>The WorkBench  also enables  each record to link to an image within a Data Set. The linked images display in an image window that can be toggled on or off. This is particularly useful for entering data from  scanned catalog cards or specimen labels. <br>
</p>
<h3><u>Using the WorkBench </u></h3>
<p>Before using The WorkBench, it is important to understand its components and how they interact with each other. The two major components of the WorkBench are the Sidebar and  Workspace. </p>
<p><img src="../images/openscreen1.png" alt="open screen"></p>
<br>
<h3><u>Sidebar</u></h3>
<p> The Sidebar contains Data and Action items:</p>
<p><img src="../images/openscreen3.png" alt="Sidebar sub components"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Data section lists all the Data Sets </p>
<p>Actions are used to manipulate the Data Sets. There are three ways to initiate an action from the Sidebar:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click   an Action, then choose a Data Set from the resulting dialog </li>
  <li>Drag an Action and drop it onto a Data Set</li>
  <li>Drag a Data Set and drop it onto an Action</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h3><u><a name="DragAndDrop"></a>Drag and Drop </u></h3>
<p> Every Sidebar item, except Import Data and Import Images, takes advantage of the 'drag and drop' functionality. For instance, dragging a Data Set  onto Export Data Set will export that Data Set. Dragging Export Data Set onto a Data Set will produce the same result.</p>
<p>When a Data Set is dragged, all Actions associated with Data Sets will highlight in green. Non-drag and drop items are identified by a blue outline. Also, grabbing a Data Set and dragging it downward will produce a green outline around all the Action items that the Data Set can be dropped onto. <br>
</p>
<h3><u>SideBar Items </u></h3>
<p>Sidebar items are further categorized by function; i.e. Actions, Reports,  and Data Sets.</p>
<br>
<table width="95%" border="1">
  <tr>
    <td width="8%">Actions: </td>
    <td width="11%"><span class="style1">Import Data </span></td>
    <td width="81%">Imports data from an MS Excel or CSV file.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">Reports:</td>
    <td><span class="style1">Data Set Summary</span></td>
    <td>Displays a summary of occurrence counts for a single column within the Data Set. This is particularly useful when editing data to validate the input. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td><em>Basic Label </em></td>
    <td>Creates a label from predefined column headings.</td>
  </tr>

    <td><span class="style1">Chart</span></td>
    <td>Displays a Bar Chart summary of occurrence counts for a single column within the Data Set.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td><span class="style1">Top 10 </span></td>
    <td>Displays a Pie Chart of the top 10 occurrence counts for a single column within the Data Set.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">Data Sets </td>
    <td valign="top"><span class="style1">(Data Set names) </span></td>
    <td><p>Shows a list of  Data Sets. Click the name to open the Data Set in the Workspace. </p>
        <p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> When a Data Set is inactive in the Workspace it becomes disabled on the Sidebar. </p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><u>Trash Can </u></h3>
<p>Delete any non-active Data Set by dragging it to the trash can. <br>
</p>
<h3><u>WorkSpace </u></h3>
<p>Data Sets and Reports open  in the Workspace. The components of the Workspace are listed below: </p>
<h3><img src="../images/openscreen2.png" alt="screen2"></h3>
<br>
<h3><u>Tabs </u></h3>
<p>The WorkBench allows many Data Sets to be open at the same time, but only one can be active in the Workspace. The WorkBench creates a tab for each open Data Set.</p>
<br>
<h3><u>Close Workspace</u></h3>
<p>Select the 'x' to close an open Data Set or Report. </p>
<br>
<h3><u>Getting Started </u></h3>
<p>Data Sets are created using different Actions depending on the Work Flow. The following table lists a variety of Work Flows and the relevant WorkBench solution: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table width="75%" border="0" cellpadding="8">
  <tr>
    <td><u><strong>Work Flow </strong></u></td>
    <td><u><strong>Action</strong></u></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I have data in an Excel spreadsheet</td>
    <td> The &quot;Import Data&quot; action will import the data into a Data Set and map the existing columns to the Specify fields.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I have data in a database format </td>
    <td>Export the data as a CSV file and use the &quot;Import Data&quot; action to import the data into a Data Set and map the existing columns to Specify fields. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I have legacy data (cards, labels, catalog pages) as images </td>
    <td>The &quot;Import Images&quot; action will create a Data Set with each card image linked to a single record. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I have legacy data on physical cards, labels or catalog pages </td>
    <td>The &quot;New Data Set&quot; action will allow you to choose column headings from Specify fields and create a Data Set for entering your data. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I have locality information on field notes</td>
    <td>The &quot;New Data Set&quot; action will allow you to choose column headings from Specify fields and create a Data Set for entering your data. </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>I will be visiting a collaborating Institution and want to take my data with me </td>
    <td>Save the entire WorkBench Component and accompanying Data Sets onto a portable medium (USB key, CD, etc). </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will be visiting a collaborating Institution and want to take my data with me but they use a Mac and I use a PC </td>
    <td>No problem! The WorkBench works the same on systems using Windows, Mac OS X as well as Linux. Simply save the entire WorkBench Component and accompanying Data Sets onto a USB key and run the  WorkBench on your associate's Macintosh.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will be visiting a collaborating Institution and want to  merge our data but their data is in Excel </td>
    <td>The &quot;Export Data Set&quot; action will export your data into an Excel spreadsheet, which can then be merged with their data. Thereafter, the file can be imported as a single Data Set into the WorkBench.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>I want to verify my data that exists in a non-Specify database </td>
    <td><p>Export the data as a CSV file from your database and then use the &quot;Import Data&quot; action to import the data into a WorkBench Data Set by mapping the existing columns into Specify fields. Then you can use the reporting features to verify your data. </p></td>
  </tr>
