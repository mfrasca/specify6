<h2>Data Set  Backup  </h2>
<hr>
<p>Data Sets created in the WorkBench are saved within the DerbyDatabase directory. In order to back up your Data Sets you would need to backup this directory to another location. This would backup all Data Sets. The WorkBench also creates MS Excel backups of each Data Set in the SpecifyWB/Specify/Backups directory each time a Data Set is saved. The Specify directory is the primary data directory for the WorkBench and is the location for Preferences and backups.</p>
