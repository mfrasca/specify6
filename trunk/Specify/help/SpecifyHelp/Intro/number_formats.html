<h2>Creating Field Formats</h2>
<p>Accession and Catalog Number formats are created during the Specify set up but there may be other numbers that require a format, such as Gifts and Loans. These can be formatted in the Schema Configuration tool, which will change the format for the entire discipline. In other words, if a Gift Number  is formatted in the schema configuration all the collections within the discipline will be required to use the new format, which will display on the Gift form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once created, the formats are available for use by any collection or division by ...</p>
<p>Create and choose a format for a field in the Field Formatting Editor, which is available in the Schema Configuration tool (<em>System &gt; Schema Configuration</em>). </p>
<p>Once in the Schema Configuration tool choose a table and field from the Table and Field lists (on the left side of the tool) respectively.</p>
<p>Field formatting functions are configured using the Format Type section at the bottom of the Schema Configuration tool.</p>
<p>Choose <em>Formatting</em> from the pick list next to the Format Type caption.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Create a Field Format</h4>
<p>Click the <em>...</em> button to open the Field Formatting Editor.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/number_format_1.png" width="360" height="184" /></p>
<p>The table, field and field length information is located on the top left.</p>
<p><strong>Name</strong> is used within the application files. It should be text only and and will not be displayed to the user anywhere else in the application.</p>
<p><strong>Title</strong> will be displayed in any application format lists that are presented to the user. </p>
<p>A format can be made up of one or many sub fields. Begin creating a format by clicking the <img src="../../images/add.png" width="16" height="16" />(add) button on the right side of the editor to add a sub field. </p>
<p>Next, choose the type of sub field to add.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/number_format_2.png" width="360" height="184" /></p>
<p><strong>Numeric</strong> may only be numbers and can be auto incremented by checking the 'Is Incremented' box and using Auto Numbering when entering data. When auto numbering Specify will start incrementing from the highest number present for the sub field within the database. A numeric sub field can be set between 1 and 10 characters in length. To start a new count for each year check the <em>Restart counter every year</em> box.</p>
<p><strong>Alphanumeric</strong> may use both alphabet characters a through z and numbers and can be set between 1 and 10 characters in length.</p>
<p><strong>Alpha</strong> may only be alphabet characters a through z and may be set between 1 and 10 characters in length.</p>
<p><strong>Separator</strong> refers to a character that separates the various sub fields. Separator choices include - . / ' ' _ and are one character in length.</p>
<p><strong>Year</strong> will automatically add the current year on a form, but can be edited. </p>
<p><strong>Anychar(acter)</strong> allows any alphabet characters a through z, any number or any other keyboard character and can be set between 1 and 10 characters in length.</p>
<p><strong>Constant</strong> refers to  any sub field that will remain constant and is not editable on a form. This type of sub field is useful when  an institution code is part of a format. Type the characters for the constant in the text field labeled <em>Text</em> located under the <em>Type</em> box. </p>
<p>Once the sub field information is configured correctly add it to the format by clicking the <img src="../../images/green_up_arrow.png" width="16" height="16" /> button. The sub field will appear in the window with the appropriate information in each of the columns (Type, Value, Size, Is By Year, Is Incremented).</p>
<p>Reorder sub fields by clicking the <img src="../../images/ReorderUp16x16.png" width="16" height="16" /> (reorder up) and <img src="../../images/ReorderDown16x16.png" width="16" height="16" /> (reorder down) buttons on the right side of the editor. </p>
<p>Delete unwanted sub fields by clicking the <img src="../../images/delete.png" width="16" height="16" /> (delete) button.</p>
<p>Continue adding sub fields until the format is complete and displays correctly in the <em>Sample</em> window at the bottom of the editor.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note: </strong></em>When manually entering a formatted number field, it is paramount that numbers be padded with 0's. For example, if 3 numbers are available in a numbering scheme (###) and the desired number is 1, then 001 must be entered. If only 1 is entered, then Specify will read this as 100. This will produce incorrect results in searches, queries and reports. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Choose a Field Format</p>
<p>Once a field format has been configured it will need to be selected from the center pick list. </p>

<p>Specify serves several collection disciplines, each with its own practices and traditions. Some of the concepts that underlie Specify will be familiar to some collections and unfamiliar to others. However, a few basic concepts deserve mention. Specify requires a unique catalog number for each specimen. It does not matter what catalog number you use for a specimen as long as the number is unique for the catalog series. Many museums routinely assign catalog numbers to incoming specimens. Those institutions can simply enter catalog numbers determined through the museum's accepted cataloging practices. Some institutions do not use catalog numbers. Many herbaria, for example, have never maintained a printed catalog. Those institutions may question the need to assign each specimen a catalog number in Specify. But nothing in the Specify environment requires changes to your existing methods for organizing and storing specimens. For example, you can still store sheets by genus and species in phylogenetic or alphabetical order if that is your established procedure. If you do not use catalog numbers and do not want to assign a number just for Specify, you can configure Specify to automatically assign a catalog number to each new specimen and then ignore the numbers for all practical purposes. </p>
<p>For institutions that have an existing format for their catalog number, Specify offers a number formatting tool that can accomodate numbers, institution codes and years. Accessions, Loans and Gifts also require unique numbers and can be formatted using the formatting tool.</p>
