<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Specify&rsquo;s user interface has been designed to provide easy access to data and to the various processing features and functions of the application.&nbsp; Our target was to make everything easily accessible regardless of where you are at in the application, through the use of the Menu Bar and Task Bar at the top of the Specify window, the Side Bar on the left, and the Tabs on the bottom of the Specify workspace. Up to 11 work space windows can now be opened at one time.&nbsp; Tabs allow quick, one-click navigation among data forms, trees and other Specify pages. The figure below shows the various screen components of the Specify window with definitions that follow.</p>
<h3><strong><u>Components in Specify</u></strong></h3>

Status Bar</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Menu Bar</strong> </h4>
<p>The menu bar across the top organizes commands and modules under menus and submenus. Clicking on a module will open a list of its components in the side bar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Task Bar</h4>
<p>The task bar located at the top of the Specify application is a set of buttons that launch a task-related module. The task bar can be moved by clicking on the 2 vertical lines found on the left side of the task bar and dragging it away from the application. To move the task bar back to the application click the close  button. </p>
<p>Clicking on a task bar button will open a list its components in the side bar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Side Bar</h4>
<p>The side bar allows a list of  components for each module to be activated in the work space. The  list typically consists of the  actions (print, import) and data (types of forms) available within a module. The side bar will change to reflect the tools available within the active module. </p>
<p>Resize the side bar  by mousing over the line separating the side bar from the work space until a crossbar appears, then click and drag the line to the desired size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Work Space</h4>
<p>The work space is the area within the application where tasks are completed. Clicking a module component from the side bar list opens it in the work space. Many work space windows can be open at the same time, but only one can be active.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Trash Can</h4>
<p>The trash can allows a saved item (Record Set, Query, Report or Information Request) listed on the side bar to be deleted by dragging and dropping it onto the image.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tab Bar / Tabs</strong></p>
<p>Tabs on the tab bar allow work space windows to be activated and closed. More than one window can be open at a time, but only one may be active in the work space, these windows are shown as  tabs on the tab bar under the work space. Click a tab to activate the window. </p>
<p>The tab bar allows 11 tabs, but not all can be viewed at one time. When the tabs move off the tab bar, arrows (<img src="../../images/left_arrow.png" alt="left" width="8" height="10" /> <img src="../../images/right_arrow.png" alt="right" width="8" height="10" />) become available for viewing and selecting  tabs.</p>
<p>Tabs are labeled with an icon and module name. If two of the same modules are open the tab will reflect the number of modules that are open. </p>
<p>Example: <img src="../../images/two_tabs.png" alt="2" width="341" height="22" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <em>Tabs</em> menu on the Specify 6 menu bar gives the following shortcuts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Close Current</li>
  <li>Close All </li>
  <li>Close All Except Current </li>
</ul>
<p>Close tabs  by clicking  the <img src="../images/closeHover.gif" alt="close" width="12" height="12" /> (close) button on the right side of the tab. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Status Bar</h4>
<p>The Status Bar at the bottom of the application displays the User, Discipline and Collection name. When appropriate it also displays messages such as invalid data entry and the status of a search.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><u>Levels within Specify</u></h3>
<p>Specify 6 is designed to store all the data for an institution in one database. This may include many divisions, disciplines, and collections. Each  of these levels within an institution has unique data needs; therefore many of the tools within Specify, such as forms and trees, are also unique to each level. Collection object data kept within the individual collections and Specify therefore opens in a specific collection. For more information regarding levels within Specify please refer to ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Change Collections</strong></p>
<p>Each session of Specify opens to a collection. The first time Specify is opened a dialog will ask which collection the user wishes to open, then Specify will open to the last collection that was open. </p>
<p>To change a collection  choose <em>File &gt; Change Collection</em>, then choose a collection from the resulting dialog. </p>
<p>When changing collections the application first shuts all windows. This closes the user out of the collection and a new collection must be chosen before the <em>Change Collections</em> dialog will close.</p>
<p>Available collections are based on the permissions the user has been given.</p>
<p>Specify 6 displays the current collection name on the right side of the Status Bar.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Selecting <em>Change Collection</em> closes the current collection as well as all open tabs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><u><strong>User Permissions</strong></u></h4>
<p>Specify includes a highly flexible Security module that allows a system administrator to add users, then limit their operations within and access to the various modules and components in Specify. Tools described in the documentation may not be available to  users if they have not been given permission to use them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><u>Terms used in the Documentation</u></h4>
<p>Windows that open outside the work space are referred to as <em>Dialogs</em>. </p>
<p>A right-button click that results in a list box is referred to as a <em>Context Menu</em>. </p>
