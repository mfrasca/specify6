This screen enables you to 'check' your Specify 'Master' username and password. If you are unable to successfully login
you can reset your Master password. This should be done as a last resort when you have several users. The 'Master Key' that has been generated for each 
user requires the Master password and therefore a new Master Key will have to be generated for each user.
</p>
<p>
Upon resetting the Master password you will be presented with a popup dialog that will enable you to select one or more databases that will
be associated with the new Master password. Select only the databases that are currently using the Master username and password you just reset.
