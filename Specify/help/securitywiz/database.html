This form tests the validity of the Specify &quot;IT User&quot; name and password. For standalone workstation installations of Specify (without a dedicated MySQL Server computer) the Specify IT User is typically the root user account in the MySQL installation. The user name is &quot;root&quot; and the password is whatever was specified during the MySQL installation on that workstation. You must validate your &quot;IT User&quot; (MySQL &quot;root&quot; user) name and password in this window to be able to use this tool.
</p>  
<p>
 At institutions which share a MySQL server for one or more institutional databases, the Specify &quot;IT User&quot; is typically NOT the MySQL root user account, but rather a named user granted several permissions to create and modify Specify databases only-for more information, see the documentation for installing MySQL on a shared server on the Specify Software Project web site.
</p>
<p>
This version of the Specify DB Security Wizard does not work with Specify IT User names which are not &quot;root&quot;.  If you are having a problem connecting a Specify installation on a workstation to a dedicated MySQL server and your Specify IT User in MySQL is not &quot;root&quot;, please contact the Specify Software Project for assistance.
