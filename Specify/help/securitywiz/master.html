This form allows you to test the validity of your &quot;Master&quot; account username and password in MySQL.  If the Master username or password is incorrect, you can try additional possibilities. Ultimately, if you are unable to determine the correct user name and password, both can be reset with this tool to new values. Resetting the Specify &quot;Master&quot; username and password should only be done if absolutely necessary because doing so will force the recreation of every user password for the database. If you reset the Master username and password, all user accounts in Specify will immediately be unable to access the database until each user access key is re-created with the Master account name and password.
</p>
<p>
After resetting the Master username and password, a window will appear which allows the choice of which collection databases will be assigned the new Master username and password. If you have multiple Specify databases installed in MySQL, it is critical to select only the database(s) that will be using the new Master account username and password, otherwise users of other Specify databases on your server will be locked out of accessing Specify data until each of their individual Specify user encrypted password keys are recreated.
