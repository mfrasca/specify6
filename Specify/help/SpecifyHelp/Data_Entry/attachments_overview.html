    Specify allows several file types to be attached to records
    <ul>
      <li>text</li>
      <li>audio</li>
      <li>video<br>
      </li>
      <li>binary</li>
      <li>pdf</li>
      <li>image (jpg, png, gif, tiff)</li>

      <li>others</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><br>

    <h3>Attach Files</h3>
    <blockquote> Files can be attached to records via the <a
        href="../Data_Entry/Data_Entry.html">Form system</a>, <a
        href="../Uploading/wb_uploader.html">WorkBench Uploads</a> and,
      available in Specify 6.5, group uploads using <a
        href="../Attachments/attachment_tools.html">Attachment Tools</a>.
      <br>
      <br>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>View Attachments</h3>
    <blockquote> <a href="../Attachments/attachment_tools.html">Attachment
        Tools</a> also enable users to browse thumbnail representations
      of all attachments within a collection in a workspace window,
      locate additional information about an attachment, and open an
      associated record in a form view.<br>
      <br>
      Double click an image attachment thumbnail to open it within the
      Specify workspace from within a form or attachment tools. Double
      click a non-image attachment to launch an appropriate software
      application downloaded on the computer hard drive.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      The Attachment Tools can be used to view/browse a limited set of
      attachments by first creating a query in the Query Builder, then
      clicking the <img alt="attachment"
        src="../../images/attachment_20.png" height="20" width="20"> <i>Attachment</i>
      button located on the <a
        href="../QueryBuilder/Query_Builder.html#q_results">Query
        Results Tool Bar</a>.<br>
      <p><i><b>Note:</b></i> thumbnails are created for jpg, png and
        most pdfs. Other file types are represented by a default
        thumbnail based on their file type.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Store Attachments</h3>
    <blockquote> Attachments are copied, renamed using a unique name,
      and stored in an Attachment Storage location. Only the path to the
      attachment storage location is stored in the Specify database. The
      Specify Setup Wizard sets a default storage location on the local
      drive but this location can be changed in System Preferences:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>For Mac: Specify &gt; Preferences &gt; System &gt;
          Attachment Storage Location.</li>
        <li>For PC and Linux: Choose Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; System
          &gt; Attachment Storage Location.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Attachments can be stored on a local hard drive, network drive
        or an attachment server. Specify creates a directory named
        'originals' for storing the attachment files, and a directory
        named 'thumbnails' for storing the thumbnails it creates. These
        directories are created within the specified attachment storage
        directory.<br>
      </p>
      <p>When storing attachments on a local drive attachments may not
        be shared. For example, if user1 attaches an image and stores it
        on their local drive and user2 logs into the same collection,
        user2 will not be able to access the attachment. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Storing attachments on a network drive allows the attachments
        to be shared. In the example above, storing the attachments on a
        network drive will allow user2 to view, open and export
        attachments.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Museums with access to IT personnel may consider storing
        attachments in an attachment server. This is an alternative to
        storing attachments on a network drive and allows a web server
        to directly access the attachment location.<br>
      </p>
      <p><br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Change Computer/Backup Attachments</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Attachments are not stored in the database and therefore are
        not included in a backup of a database. Only the path to the
        attachment storage location is included in the database.
        Attachments stored on a local hard drive should be backed up as
        part of the local system backup procedure.<br>
      </p>
      <p>To access attachments on an alternate computer when the
        attachment storage location is on a local hard drive will
        require the attachment directory to be copied to the alternate
        computer. Copy the attachment storage location/directory in the
        exact same path on the new computer. For example: If John Smith
        is using machineA but upgrades to machineB and his attachment
        storage path is c:/users/john/myattachments he will need to copy
        the entire myattachments directory from machineA to machineB and
        place the myattachments directory in c:/users/john.<br>
      </p>
      <p>To access attachments on an alternate computer when the
        attachment storage location is on either a shared network drive
        or attachment server simply change the attachment path in the
        System Preferences on the new computer.<br>
      </p>
