    Specify allows several file types to be attached to records
    <ul>
      <li>text</li>
      <li>audio</li>
      <li>binary</li>
      <li>pdf</li>
      <li>image (jpg, png, gif, tiff)</li>
      <li>html</li>
      <li>spreadsheet</li>
      <li>others</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Attach Files</h3>
    Files can be attached to records via the <a
      href="../Data_Entry/Data_Entry.html">Form system</a>, <a
      href="../Uploading/wb_uploader.html">WorkBench Uploads,</a> and,
    available in Specify 6.5, group uploads using <a
      href="../Attachments/attachment_tools.html">Attachment Tools</a>.
    Attachment tools also includes an Attachment Browser that displays
    all attachments within a single collection as thumbnails. The
    attachment browser also offers access to additional attachment
    information and its associated record. <br>
    <h3><br>
    </h3>
    <h3>Store Attachments</h3>
    Attachments are copied, renamed using a unique name, and stored in
    an Attachment Storage location. Only the path to the attachment
    storage location is stored in the Specify database. The Specify
    Setup Wizard sets a default storage location on the local drive but
    this location can be changed in System Preferences:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>For Mac: Specify &gt; Preferences &gt; System &gt; Attachment
        Storage Location.</li>
      <li>For PC and Linux: Choose Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; System
        &gt; Attachment Storage Location.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Attachments can be stored on a local hard drive, network drive or
      an attachment server. Specify creates a directory named
      'originals' for storing the attachment files, and a directory
      named 'thumbnails' for storing the thumbnails it creates. These
      directories are created within the specified attachment storage
      directory.<br>
    </p>
    <p>When storing attachments on a local drive attachments may not be
      shared. For example, if user1 attaches an image and stores it on
      their local drive and user2 logs into the same collection, user2
      will not be able to access the attachment. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Storing attachments on a network drive allows the attachment to
      be shared. In the example above if the attachments are stored on a
      network drive user2 can log into the original collection and view,
      open and export attachments.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Museums with access to IT personnel may consider storing
      attachments in an attachment server. This is an alternative to
      storing attachments on a network drive and allows a web server
      direct access to the attachment location.<br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h3>Change Computer/Backup Attachments</h3>
    <p>Attachments are not stored in the database and therefore are not
      included in a backup of a database. Only the path to the
      attachment storage location is included in the database.
      Attachments stored on a local hard drive should be backed up as
      part of the local system backup procedure.<br>
    </p>
    <p>To access attachments on an alternate computer when the
      attachment storage location is on a local hard drive will require
      the attachment directory to be copied to the alternate computer.
      Copy the attachment storage location/directory in the exact same
      path on the new computer. For example: If John Smith is using
      machineA but upgrades to machineB and his attachment storage path
      is c:/users/john/myattachments he will need to copy the entire
      myattachments directory from machineA to machineB and place the
      myattachments directory in c:/users/john.<br>
    </p>
    <p>To access attachments on an alternate computer when the
      attachment storage location is on either a shared network drive or
      attachment server simply change the attachment path in the System
      Preferences on the new computer.<br>
