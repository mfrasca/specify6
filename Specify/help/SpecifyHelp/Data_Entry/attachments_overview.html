    Specify allows several file types to be attached to records:
    <ul>
      <li>text</li>
      <li>audio</li>
      <li>video<br>
      </li>
      <li>binary</li>
      <li>pdf</li>
      <li>image (jpg, png, gif, tiff)</li>
      <li>html</li>
      <li>spreadsheet<br>
      </li>
      <li>others</li>
  </ul>

    <h3>Attach Files</h3>
    <blockquote> Files can be attached to records via the <a
        href="../Data_Entry/Data_Entry.html">Form system</a>, <a
        href="../Uploading/wb_uploader.html">WorkBench Uploads,</a> and, new in Specify 6.5, 
        <a href="../Data_Entry/attachments_overview.html">Attachment Tools</a>.

    <h3><a name="view_attach" id="view_attach"></a>View Attachments and Associated Information</h3>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><a href="../Data_Entry/attachments_overview.html">Attachment
        Tools</a>  enable users to browse thumbnail representations
      of all attachments associated with a collection in a workspace window. The browse can also be limited to show only image attachments. </p>
      <p>Attachments associated with a single record can be viewed using the <a
        href="../Data_Entry/Data_Entry.html">Form system</a>.<br>
      <br>
      Double clicking an image attachment thumbnail in either a form or the attachment browser will open the file in a Specify tab. Double clicking a non-image attachment will open it in the appropriate application on the workstation. If Specify can not find the appropriate application it may be necessary to export the attachment and open it from within the application itself. <br>
      <br>
      The Attachment Tools can be used to view/browse a limited set of
      attachments by first creating a query in the Query Builder, then
      clicking the <img alt="attachment"
        src="../../images/attachment_20.png" height="20" width="20"> <i>Attachment</i>
      button located on the <a
        href="../QueryBuilder/Query_Builder.html#q_results">Query
        Results Tool Bar</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><i><b>Note:</b></i> thumbnails are created for jpg, png and
        most pdfs. Other file types are represented by a default
        thumbnail based on their file type.</blockquote>
      Information associated with the attachment can be viewed in the <a href="../Data_Entry/attachment_tools.html">Attachment
        Tools</a>, including associated record information and any available metadata. </p>

    <h3><a name="store_attach" id="store_attach"></a>Store Attachments</h3>
    <blockquote> Attachments are copied, renamed using a unique string,
      and stored in an Attachment Storage location. Only the path to the
      attachment storage location is stored in the Specify database. The
      Specify Setup Wizard sets a default storage location on the local
      drive but this location can be changed in System Preferences:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>For Mac: Specify &gt; Preferences &gt; System &gt;
          Attachment Storage Location.</li>
        <li>For PC and Linux: Choose Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; System
          &gt; Attachment Storage Location.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Attachments can be stored on a local hard drive, network drive
        or an attachment server. When storing attachments on a local or network drive, Specify creates a directory named
        'originals' for storing the attachment files, and a directory
        named 'thumbnails' for storing the thumbnails it creates. These
        directories are created within the specified attachment storage
        directory.</p>
      <p>When storing attachments on a local drive attachments may not
        be shared with other workstations. For example, if User 1 attaches an image and stores it
        on their local drive and User 2 logs into their instance of Specify on another workstation, User 2 will not be able to access the attachment.</p>
      <p>Storing attachments on a network drive allows the attachments
        to be shared. In the example above, storing the attachments on a
        network drive will allow User 2 to view, open and export
        attachments.</p>
      <p>Museums with access to IT personnel may consider storing
        attachments in an attachment server. This is an alternative to
        storing attachments on a network drive and allows a web server
      to directly access the attachment location.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> all collections within the same division must share a directory in the storage location. If a directory is not shared, tables which share data will not have access to attachments. For instance, within Specify two collections in the same divison share Agent information. If each collection stores its attachments in unique directories in the storage location and an attachment is added to an Agent record in Collection 1 information within the Agent record will be accessible for users in Collection 2, but the Agent Attachment will not be available and will show a status of missing.</p>

    <h3><a name="backup_attach" id="backup_attach"></a>Change Computer/Backup Attachments</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Attachments are not stored in the database and therefore are
        not included in a backup of a database. Only the path to the
        attachment storage location is included in the database.
        Attachments stored on a local hard drive should be backed up as
        part of the local system backup procedure.</p>
      <p>To access attachments on an alternate computer when the
        attachment storage location is on a local hard drive will
        require the attachment directory to be copied to the alternate
        computer. Copy the attachment storage location/directory into the
        exact same path on the new computer. For example: If John Smith
        is using machineA but upgrades to machineB and his attachment
        storage path is c:/users/john/myattachments he will need to copy
        the entire myattachments directory from machineA to machineB and
        place the myattachments directory in c:/users/john.<br>
      </p>
      <p>To access attachments on an alternate computer when the
        attachment storage location is on either a shared network drive
        or attachment server, simply change the attachment path in the
        System Preferences on the new computer.<br>
      </p>
