<h2>Data Recovery</h2>
<p>Each time a Data Set is saved, the WorkBench makes a backup of it in the 'Backup' directory. The WorkBench will save 5 backup files for each Data Set; meaning that there is a copy of the last 5 versions of the Data Set. When 5 backup files of a Data Set exist in the backup directory, the oldest backup file will be overwritten the next time the Data Set is saved. </p>
<p>Backup files are named with a unique number and the name of the Data Set. </p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Image information is not saved in these backup files. Reverting to an older version of a Data Set will delete all image information. </p>
