<p>Specify has utilized the power of iReport 3.0, an open source report writing software package, by changing the original version to interact with Queries created in Specify 6 and  the Specify 6 database. </p>
<p>In-depth documentation for using iReport can be accessed from their <a href="http://jasperforge.org/website/ireportwebsite/IR%20Website/iReport_documentation.html?group_id=243&header=project&leftnav=yes&target=ireport">web page</a>. The following documentation is meant  to  explain how to use the functionality on the Reports Sidebar, bring a Specify Query into the Specify 6 version of iReport then create a print simple report. </p>
<p>The Specify staff also provide limited report-writing services for all registered Specify users. To benefit from their expertise please contact them at <a href="mailto:specify@ku.edu">specify@ku.edu</a>.
<p>To access the Report tools click the <img src="../../images/Reports20x20.png" width="20" height="20" /> Reports button on the Task Bar. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><u>SideBar Items</u></h3>
<p>It is important to note that the distinction between reports and labels in Reports is purely an organizational function. Reports and labels are created exactly the same in iReports and run and print the same from within Specify.</p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p><u>Run Report</u> also refers to labels.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Drag a Report or Label and drop it on this button or click the button to open a dialog and choose a Report/Label.</li>
  <li>Change any expressions in the resulting Prompt dialog before running the Report. </li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Note</strong></em>: Prompts will only appear for Query expressions that include a checked Prompt box. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Import </u></p>
<p>Users that can program in MySQL can create their own report for inclusion in Specify 6. Create the Report including this Report Query Where clause: &quot;where co.collectionobjectid $P!{itemnum} . Also include a paramenter named &quot;itemnum&quot;. </p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose Import and use the file dialog to locate the Report. This will add the report in the Sidebar.</li>
  <li>Drop a Record Set on the Report to run it.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Refresh</u></p>
<p>Reports created in iReport are saved in the database and will not automatically appear on the Reports Sidebar. Click Refresh to add recently saved reports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Reports</strong></p>
<p>Saved Reports are listed under this heading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Labels</strong></p>
<p>Reports can be saved as Reports or Labels. Labels are listed under this heading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Record Sets</strong></p>
<p>Reports can be executed by dragging and dropping a Record Set onto them in the Sidebar. Reports that can accept a Record Set will include a colored outline. An arrow will also appear within the outline when the Record Set can be dropped onto the Report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong> <u>Query</u></strong></h3>
<p>Reports within the Specify version of iReport use a Query; therefore, the first step in creating a Report is to create and save a Query. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Choose Query from the Specify Taskbar..</li>
  <li>Select what type of Query to create. (e.g. Agent, Collecting Event, Collection Object, etc)</li>
  <li>Choose the query expressions to be used.</li>
  <li>Save the Query.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see <a href="../Query Builder/query.html">Query Builder</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><u>iReport</u></h3>
<p>iReport ships with Specify but is a separate application and must be launched separately from Specify. SpecifyiReport is located in the Specify application directory, in the <strong><em>bin</em></strong> file, which stores the executable files for Specify. Double click <em>SpecifyiReport</em> to launch iReport.</p>
<p>The following text will step the user through a set-up wizard, then add conditions for the report. </p>
<p>Choose <em>File &gt; Report Wizard</em> from within SpecifyiReport and  choose a saved Query for the report. </p>
<p>A <strong>Report Properties</strong> dialog will appear allowing for basic report set-up.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Report Name</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Page Size</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Page Margin</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Columns</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Scriplet Classes</strong> are Java classes that can be used to execute special events during printing. Users that are familiar with Java can include custom scriplets in this tab.</li>
  <li><strong>More</strong> includes choices for printing title, summary, column footer, pagination, print order and how to handle  no data. </li>
  <li><strong>i18n</strong> allows special Java classes, bundles and encoding to be implemented for printing formatted fields, internationalizing a report and saving source files.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bands</strong></p>
<p>Once the basic set-up is complete, an emptly report will appear. iReport separates  reports into sections, or bands. Data is then printed according to their band band definition. For example, a title is printed once but detail is repeated for every record.</p>
<table width="700" border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="6">
  <tr>
    <td><div align="center"><u><strong>Report Band</strong></u></div></td>
    <td><div align="center"><u><strong>Description</strong></u></div></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><div align="center">title</div></td>
    <td>Only created once in the report and can be its own page.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><div align="center">page header</div></td>
    <td>Appears on all pages (except title and summary pages that are included as their own page) in the same position.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><div align="center">column header</div></td>
    <td>Printed at the beginning of each detail column.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><div align="center">detail</div></td>
    <td>Corresponds to every record that feeds the report.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><div align="center">column footer</div></td>
    <td>Appears at the end of every column.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><div align="center">page footer</div></td>
    <td>Appears on every page that includes a page header.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><div align="center">last page footer</div></td>
    <td>Creates a unique footer for the last page.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><div align="center">summary</div></td>
    <td>Allows  fields to be inserted for ending statements such as total calculations or means.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Panes</strong></p>
<p>Menus to the side of the Workspace in iReport are called Panes. Three main panes that are helpful to have open are <em>Document Structure</em>, <em>Properties</em> and <em>Library</em>. These can be opened/closed in <em>View &gt; Docking Panes</em>. Any item within these panes can be dragged and dropped into a band. When the item is dropped into a band the expression that represents it is displayed in a Text Field. </p>
<p>Right-button-click on an object within the panes to display a context menu with choices for Edit, Add, Move, Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete, Add a Group and Refresh.</p>
<p>Note: Objects within the panes can also be manipulated via a grid by choosing <em>View &gt; (Fields, Parameters or Variables)</em>. </p>
<u>Document Structure</u>
<p>The Document Structure is  organized into 3 sections:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fields</strong> lists the fields in the Query.</li>
  <li><strong>Parameters</strong> are the programmatical values created by Specify to print reports from iReport. </li>
  <li><strong>Variables</strong> are used to store the results of calculations, such as subtotals (page x of y) and sums (counts).</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure to properly place the group where you want it, and to make it the proper size. Band sizes can be adjusted to smaller or bigger sizes by right-button-clicking on their outline and dragging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<u>Properties</u> 
<p>Objects from the Document Structure that are placed into bands display their properties in this window. Properties include text formatting and expressions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<u>Library </u> (somtimes referred to in other documentation as the Object Library)
<p>The library window contains a set of tools useful to perform common tasks such a Page Number, Total Pages, Page X of Y, Total, Current Date and Percentage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Saving a Report</h3>
<p>Once a report is created to satisfaction, it can be saved by choosing <em>File &gt; Save</em>. A Report Properties dialog will appear:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Type a <strong>Name</strong> for the Report</li>
  <li>Choose the <strong>Report Type</strong> as either Report or Label. This is purely for organizational purposes. Choosing Label will list the report under the Label heading on the Reports Sidebar and choosing Report will list the report under the Report heading.</li>
  <li>Choose a <strong>Repeat</strong> variable:</li>

<ul>
  <li>Once will create one report/label.</li>
  <li>Constant duplicates the report/label the number of times selected. </li>
  <li>By Field duplicates the report/label by field. </li>
</ul></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once a report is created to satisfaction, it can be saved, and will appear in Specify. If Specify is running while the report is created and saved, press <em>Refresh</em> to have the new report appear in the Reports Sidebar.</p>
