    <h2> <a name="data_exporter"></a>Data Exporter </h2>
    <p> The Data Exporter application is used to build, update and
      export data files for use by IPT or a web portal. The term 'build'
      refers to the process Specify uses to load data into the skeleton,
      or schema, of a database. Before a data file can be built, a
      'schema map' must first be created using the Schema Mapping Editor
      inside Specify. If you have not created a schema map you will need
      to close the Data Exporter tool, reopen Specify and create the
      schema map using the Schema Mapper tool. For documentation
      explaining how to create a schema map please refer to <a
        href="../QueryBuilder/third_party.html">Web Publishing</a>. </p>
    <p> The Data Exporter tool actually creates a table, or cache, in
      the database containing all relevant data, based on the map that
      was created from inside Specify.&nbsp; This table of data is then indexed and exported, along with other relevant files,
      for use in a web portal. Or, the cache is exported as a tab delimited text file for importing
      into IPT.&nbsp; </p>
    <p> The Data Exporter application is located in the bin directory
      within the Specify application directory, which stores the
      executable files for Specify. Double click <em>DataExporter</em>
      (or select it from Start/Program Files/Specify on Windows) to
      launch the tool. Users are required to login using their Specify
      Username and Password. </p>
    <p> The Data Exporter application opens as a three column table with
      action buttons. </p>
    <p align="center"> <img src="../../images/export_tool.png"> </p>
    <p class="imgcaption" align="center">Data Exporter Tool</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li> The <strong>Mapping</strong> column of the table indicates
        the name of both the mapping and table. </li><br />
      <li> The <strong>Last Update</strong> column lists the date and
        time of the last update of the cache. </li><br />
      <li>The<strong> Status</strong> column indicates whether the cache has ever been build, up to date, orout of date. If the cache is out of date, it also indicates the number of rows which require updating. The number of out of date rows includes the number of rows that have been deleted from the database, edited in the database and added since the last update. This information reflects the database contents at the time the exporter was launched; it will not reflect changes to the database that occur while the exporter is running. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp; </p>
    <h3> <strong>Available Actions</strong> </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> <strong>Show SQL</strong> - Click this button for a mapping
        whose cache has been completed to generate a dialog showing an
        SQL select statement that can be copied and used when defining
        database connections to the cache for IPT or other data
        providers.
        <blockquote>
          <p> <em><strong>Note</strong></em>: the SQL is based on the
            current cache structure. If the cache needs to be rebuilt
            and mappings have been changed, the SQL statement generated
            will not reflect the changes until the cache is updated. </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li> <em> </em> <strong>Build/Update</strong> - This will
        update the cache.&nbsp;When the cache is built or updated it is
        writing to the database; therefore, the username and password
        for the database is required before Specify can complete the
        task. </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p> For caches that do not need to be built, only out-of-date rows
        are updated. This is significantly faster than an initial build
        which can take a long time.&nbsp; Updates are not allowed for
        mappings that are being edited or updated by another user;
        therefore, users should close all schema mappings before
        updating.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b><i>Note:</i></b> building/updating the cache will require
          the IT (MySQL) Username and Password.<br>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li> <strong>Export</strong> - This exports the current contents
        of the cache to a tab-delimited text file for IPT.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Export for Web Portal</b> - Files for Solr and the web
        portal will be generated and exported as a .zip file.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <em><br>
        Cancelling an Operation</em> - You can cancel an update or
      export by clicking the <img src="../../images/close_hover.png">&nbsp;(close)





      button to close the application window. You will be asked to
      confirm the cancellation. If you cancel, you will need to start
      from the beginning the next time you perform the operation. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> <strong><span class="style1">Note</span></strong><span
          class="style1">:</span>&nbsp; If you cancel an update that
        required a rebuild, the pre-existing cache will have been
        deleted. </p>
