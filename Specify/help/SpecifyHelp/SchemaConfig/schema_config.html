<h2>Schema Configuration</h2>
<p>The Schema Configuration module is a highly functional, though somewhat complex set of tools created to configure Specify for individual Discipline needs. Changes made in the Schema Configuration will affect all Collections in the Discipline. For this reason, each Discipline is encouraged to tailor Specify to their needs as part of the Specify Setup directions. </p>
<p>The tools in Schema Configuration include:</p>
<p>Hide unused Tables or Fields</p>
<p>Change the label of Tables and Fields in Specify. The names in the schema are not editable, but the display names, referred to as labels can be edited.</p>
<p>Read/write descriptions (usage notes) for Tables and Fields.</p>
<p>Format a Table</p>
<p>Aggregate a Table</p>
<p>Format a Field as a Pick List, Weblink or Numbering Format.</p>
<p>Format a Field as a Weblink</p>
<p>Specify 6 was created to handle  all disciplines. The Schema Configuration tool allows users to hide tables and/or fields that are not being used for a particular discipline. This not only customizes Specify 6 for a specific discipline but also enables the program to run more efficiently.</p>
<p>The Schema Configuration tool can be used to:</p>
<p>hide tables and/or fields not being used in an individual discipline</p>
<p>label fields ***will this be shown on forms then?*** </p>
<p>write descriptions (usage notes)</p>
<p>associate a field to a pick list</p>
<p>format a text field </p>
<p>** Check to make sure that this is changing by Discipline and not just Collection!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> The Schema Configuration Tool is NOT a local tool, any changes made to the Schema will change every Collection throughout the Discipline. </p>

    <td>Tables with Many-to-One relationships are formatted to be represented by at least one field in both the Form System and Query Builder. Most tables are represented by only one field, (Collection Object shows the Catalog Number), but some are best represented by more than one field (Agent may be formatted to display last name, first name, middle initial). </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Aggregate</td>
    <td>Opens the Aggregation Editor (explained below).</td>
    <td>Tables with a one-to-many relationship  return aggregated data in the Query Builder. For example, a Collection Object can have many Preparations. The results of a query of Collection Objects wtih Preparations will return Preparations aggregated together in one column, separated by semi colons.</td>
