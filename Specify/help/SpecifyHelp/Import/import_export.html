<h2><strong>Import/Export</strong> </h2>
<p>At this time Specify 6 does not include a Form Editor, as was found in Specify 5 Customize Forms. The forms have been created programmatically to be extremely flexible and can be exported as xml and either edited by on-site staff or emailed to the Specify staff for assistance with form editing and customization. Forms are imported and exported using the Resource Import/Export dialog.</p>
<p><strong>Other Resources</strong> can also be imported and exported through the use of this tool. </p>
<p>Choosing <em>System &gt; Resource Import/Export</em> to open the Import/Export dialog. This includes reports and some system files such as Pick Lists and Web Links files.</p>
<p>Specify implements a heirachical system which limits the accesibility of the forms/resources. This allows forms/resources to be changed and then implemented for  those users who wish to use them. When accessing forms/resources, Specify starts at the Personal level, takes the forms/resources, then moves to the next level. When duplicate forms/resources are encountered those from the first level are kept and the higher level forms/resources are ignored.</p>

<p>Forms and resources can be exported, changed and then imported as a new version of the same form/resource, or saved as a new form/resource and added to the system. </p>
<p>Forms do not export or import individually, but as a form set. The xml file contains all the forms for a particular level. Resources export as individual files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Export</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose the level at which the forms are located.</li>
  <li>Choose  a form set  to export.</li>
  <li>Click the <em>Export</em> button.</li>
  <li>Choose a name and path in the resulting file system dialog.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Import</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Choose the level to import the forms into.</li>
  <li>Click the Import button.</li>
  <li>Choose the file in the resulting file system dialog. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Revert</strong></p>
<p>Revert will delete ALL files that have ever been imported. The Uploader tool remembers the files that Specify shipped with at each level and reverts back to those files. If the Uploader recognizes imported files the <em>Revert</em> button will become enabled. </p>
