    <h2>Specify 6</h2>
    <p>Specify is a database software application designed to support
      the efficient computerization and management of biological
      collections. Specify is distributed and licensed with no charge
      for non-profit collections by the Specify Software Project, based
      in the Biodiversity Institute at the University of Kansas,
      Lawrence. The Specify Software Project and its predecessor, the
      MUSE Project, have been supported by the U.S. National Science
      Foundation since 1987. The Specify Software Project web site is
      located at <a href="http://specifysoftware.org/">http://www.specifysoftware.org</a>.
      Specify lets you easily store, organize, and retrieve information
      about the holdings of a collection, track any loans or exchanges
      of those holdings and share information within the community.
      Specify was designed to the specifications of the collection
      community data model; installations can be configured with
      multiple taxonomic collections as separate databases, or data can
      be managed together as a single, multi-disciplinary database.
      Specify’s design and functions support botany, entomology,
      herpetology, ichthyology, invertebrate zoology, mammalogy,
      ornithology, paleobotany, and vertebrate and invertebrate
      paleontology. </p>

    <h3><strong><a name="using_help" id="using_help"></a>Specify Help</strong></h3>
    <p>The Specify Help system can be opened from anywhere in the
      application by typing the<em> F1</em> key, or <em>function</em> +
      <em>F1</em> keys. The help system was designed to provide an
      overview of the modules within Specify as well as a guide for a
      given task. This is referred to as context-sensitive help. When
      performing a given task in the application, type F1 and Specify
      Help will open to the corresponding documentation page. In the
      same sense, Specify Help is best read while viewing and using the
      corresponding module in the application. A Table of Contents is
      also provided. Specify Help was written in Java Help and includes
      full-text search capabilities by clicking on the <img
