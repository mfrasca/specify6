<h2>Number Formats</h2>
<p>This needs a white paper and more work as well!</p>

<h3>Attachments</h3>
<p>If a path does not exist or Specify is not able to connect to the path the Attachment button will become disabled on the forms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attachments to records will be stored in this location. It is recommended that this storage area (attachment repository) be on the shared network drive that all users have been given Read/Write/Delete permission for, rather than on a personal (local) computer. If attachments are stored locally they can not be shared.</p>
