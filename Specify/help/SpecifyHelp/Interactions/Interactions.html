<p>The interactions forms in Specify help users create and manage documents that record loans, gifts, borrowed items, permits, shipments, accessions, and information requests.  As an example, a collection manager may respond to a request for a loan of a group of specimens to another institution for research. He or she would create a new loan record in Specify that would include the list of lent specimens, along with other required loan information. When the loan was returned, the manager would update the loan record to note the date of the return and which specimens were returned. </p>
<p> Access Interaction Forms by clicking the  <img src="../../images/interactions_20.png" width="20" height="20" /> Interactions button. A list of forms will appear in the Sidebar.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> If an Interactions button is not available on the Taskbar choose <em>Specify &gt; Preferences &gt; <img src="../../images/taskbar.png" width="32" height="32"> Taskbar</em>, then click the <em>Interactions</em> checkbox.</p>
<p>Specify 6 ships with the most frequently used forms listed on the Sidebar. </p>
<p>A <strong><a name="interactions_config" id="interactions_sidebar"></a>Side Bar Interaction Form Configuration</strong> allows the available Interaction forms listed on the Sidebar  rearranged and hidden:</p>
<p>Right-button-click in the right-side of the Sidebar to open the Form Configuration tool, then click on the <img src="../../images/configure_box.png" width="110" height="27"> button.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use the <img src="../../images/ReorderUp16x16.png" width="16" height="16">,and <img src="../../images/ReorderDown16x16.png" width="16" height="16"> (reorder) buttons to change the order in which the forms appear in the Sidebar and More Forms list.</li>
  <li>Use the <img src="../../images/Map16x16.png" width="16" height="16">, and <img src="../../images/Unmap16x16.png" width="16" height="16">  (move) buttons to hide an available Sidebar item  and vise versa. </li>
</ul>
<p>Interactions forms can be activated by either clicking them in the Sidebar. Gifts, Loans or Information Exchange will also activate by dropping a Collection Object Record Set onto them in the Sidebar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><u><strong>Unique Forms</strong></u></h3>
<p><strong><a name="int_gifts_loans" id="int_gifts_loans"></a>Gifts and Loans</strong></p>
<p>Loans and Gifts document items leaving the Institution and Collection Objects are linked to the Loan/Gift through preparations.&nbsp; The first step in creating a Loan or Gift is choosing the preparations to add to the transaction.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click either Loan or Gift in the Sidebar to start the process.</li>
</ul>
<p>If any Record Sets have been saved, a dialog appears prompting the user to either <em>Enter Catalog Numbers</em> or use an existing <em>Record Set</em>. The Record set method would be easiest when using large sets of data.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Enter Catalog Numbers</strong>  by typing the catalog numbers into the text dialog, separating multiple numbers with commas.</li><br /><br />
  <li>Select a <strong>Record Set</strong> from the list.&nbsp; If only one Record Set exists, it will be used by default. &nbsp;This can also be accomplished by dragging and dropping the Record Set onto the Information Request item in the sidebar.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, a dialog listing all preparations for each Catalog number will appear.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/loan_screen.png" width="305" height="257" /></p>
<p>Each checkbox represents a Collection Object and is labeled with catalog Number and species name.</p>
<p>Type the number of specimens of each preparation being sent on loan into the dialog or use the arrow keys.&nbsp; If multiple preparations for a single Collection Object are present, they will be listed together under the same checkbox.&nbsp; </p>
<p>All preparations can be selected at once by clicking the Select <em>All</em> button.&nbsp; The number of specimens available to be loaned is indicated next to the arrow keys.&nbsp; An indication is also given if any additional specimens are associated with previous open loans or gifts.&nbsp; In these cases the total number of available specimens would be reduced by this number.&nbsp; The <img src="../../images/info_20x20.png" width="20" height="20" />links to the loan or gift in question for further information.</p>
<p>Click <em>OK</em> to accept the preparations and progress to the Loan/Gift form where all additional information pertaining to the Loan or Gift can be added.</p>
<p>Once preparations have been added to the Loan or Gift, a <em>Generate Invoice on Save</em> check box becomes available on the form.&nbsp; If checked and the necessary query and Report have been constructed, the Report associated with this Loan or Gift will be created automatically once the Save button has been clicked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="int_return_loans" id="int_return_loans"></a>Returning Loans</h3>
<p>When returning loans, a Loan Return Prep record is created for each preparation loaned out.&nbsp; There are three values associated with each Loan Return preparation:</p>
<p><strong>Quantity</strong> &ndash; the number of each preparation loaned out</p>
<p><strong>Quantity Returned</strong> &ndash; the number of preparations returned.&nbsp; This may not equal the quantity sent out in cases of partial returns and/or lost/damaged specimens not returned (see resolved below)</p>
<p><strong>Quantity resolved</strong> &ndash; all returned preparations are resolved but in the case where specimens are lost or damaged and are no longer associated with the collection, the number resolved can be increased to correspond to the quantity loaned.&nbsp; In this case, the remarks field can be used to describe the circumstances of this discrepancy.&nbsp; </p>
<p>For the loan to be closed, the quantity loaned must equal the quantity resolved.&nbsp; In the case of a full return of a loan all three numbers would be identical for each preparation.</p>
<p>When returning all, or a large proportion of the items in a loan it is easiest to use the <em>Return Loan</em> button at the bottom of the loan form.&nbsp; This method offers a Select All feature for automatically returning all preparations.&nbsp; Clicking <em>Select All</em> will make the quantity returned and quantity resolved equal the quantity sent out for reach preparation and automatically check the <em>Is Closed</em> checkbox in the loan, thereby closing the loan.&nbsp; The <em>Return Loan</em> button will also change to <em>All Returned</em>.&nbsp; If any of these numbers are altered at any stage, thereby reopening the loan, this button will revert back to Return Loan.&nbsp; For partial returns, or when some items are resolved but not returned, due to loss or damage, the quantity returned and quantity resolved can be manually manipulated and remarks inserted.</p>
<p>Loan Return Prep&rsquo;s can also be individually altered using the Loan Return Prep button  <img src="../../images/loan_return_prep_20x20.png" width="20" height="20" /> on the Loan Preparation form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em>&nbsp; The quantity, quantity returned and quantity resolved cannot be manually edited on the Loan Preparation form.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em>&nbsp; The Is Closed check box is editable only when quantity, quantity returned and quantity resolved do not equal each other i.e. when the loan is NOT closed.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong><a name="int_info_request" id="int_info_request"></a>Information Request</strong></h3>
<p>Collection Managers are often called upon to share data records with users of the collection, other collections or in house staff.&nbsp; In most cases this is accomplished by attaching an Excel spreadsheet to an email message.&nbsp; The information shared is usually in the form of Collection objects.</p>
<p>Click Information Request in the Sidebar to start the process.</p>
<p>If any Record Sets have been saved, a dialog appears prompting the user to either Enter Catalog Numbers or use an existing Record Set.&nbsp; The Record set method would be easiest when using large sets of data.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Enter Catalog Numbers</strong>  by typing catalog numbers into the text dialog, separating multiple numbers with commas.</li><br /><li>
    Select a <strong>Record Set</strong> from the list.&nbsp; If only one Record Set exists, it will be used by default.&nbsp; This can also be accomplished by dragging and dropping the Record Set onto the Information Request item in the sidebar.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Collection Objects will be added to the Information Request form.&nbsp; Once added, <em>Send Email on Save</em> check box becomes available on the form.&nbsp; If checked and a) the recipient has an email address associated with their agent name and b) the necessary email settings have been entered in <em>Preferences &gt; Email</em>, an email will automatically be sent to the designated recipient once the Save button has been clicked.&nbsp; The attached Collection Objects will appear in the main portion of the email and also attached as a CSV file.</p>
<p>Unlike queries, Information Requests are only saved on the Sidebar and not in the database and are not searchable.&nbsp; Saved Information Requests listed on the Sidebars can be deleted by dragging and dropping them onto the trash can.&nbsp; No record will be kept in the database if an Information Request once it has been deleted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style3"><strong><a name="int_borrows" id="int_borrows"></a>Borrows</strong></p>
<p class="style2">Specimens that are on on loan from another collection can be tracked in Specify by creating a Borrow. Borrows never become part of your collection and therefore the forms and data will not be entered into any Collection Object fields or related fields. Borrows must be given an Invoice Number. </p>
<p class="style2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style3"><strong><a name="int_exchange" id="int_exchange"></a>Exchange In / Exchange Out</strong></p>
<p class="style2">The Exchange In / Exchange Out feature of Specify 6 is meant to provide a general description of the materials being exchanged, it is not meant to give an itemized list of exchange items. The Agent sending the exchange and the agent cataloging the exchange are the only fields that are required.</p>
