<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interactions forms can be activated by either clicking them in the Sidebar. Gifts, Loans or Information Exchange will also activate by dropping a Collection Object Record Set onto them in the Sidebar.</p>
<p><u><strong>Unique Forms</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Creating Gifts and Loans</strong></p>
<p>Loans and Gifts  both document items leaving the institution and are therefore created from Preparations. The first step in creating either a Loan or Gift is choosing the Preparations for the transaction. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Click either <em>Loan</em> or <em>Gift</em> in the Sidebar to start the process.</li>
</ul>
<p>If any Record Sets are available a prompt will appear to choose to either enter Catalog Numbers or use a Record Set. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Type the Catalog Numbers into the text dialog with each number separated by a comma.</li><br>
  <li>or Select a Record Set. (This can also be accomplished by dragging and dropping the Record Set on the Gift or Loan in the Sidebar rather than first clicking on the Gift or Loan).</li>
</ul>
<p>A dialog listing the Preparations for each Catalog Number will appear. </p>
<p><img src="../../images/loan_prep.png" width="255" height="76"></p>
<ul>
  <li>Check the box to include the Preparation in the transaction. Next to the box is the Catalog Number and name of the Preparation.</li>
  <li>Type the amount of each Preparation to  include in the transaction or use the arrow keys on the <img src="../../images/amount_button.png" width="15" height="23"> (amount button). The number next to the amount button indicates how many Preparations are available  for the transaction. </li>
  <li>Or, Click the Select All button, this will automatically add all available Preparations for each Collection Object that is included in the Loan.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Returning Loans</strong></p>
<p>Preparation counts must be updated when Loans are returned. </p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the Loan by searching for the Loan Number in either Simple Search or Query.</li>
  <li>Click the <em><img src="../../images/Down16x16.png" alt="down" width="16" height="16"> </em>(down arrow) button at the bottom of the form and choose Edit.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Loans are returned into <em>Loan Return Prep</em> forms. Partial loans can be returned by creating a new Loan Return Prep and editing the quantities loaned, returned or resolved. </p>
  <p>When returning a large number of loans it is best to click the <em>Return Loan</em> button. This offers a view of all current quantities and automatically creates a Loan Return Prep.</p>
<p>Important notes about Returning Loans:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <em>Is Closed</em> check box is both editable and searchable.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Information Request</strong></p>
<p>Collection Managers often share data with each other for a variety of reasons, Information Requests have been created to expedite this process. The information shared will involve at least one Collection Object, if several Collection Objects are required it may be easiest to create a Record Set from either a Simple Search or Query. Then create the Information Request:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click <em>Information Request</em> in the Sidebar to start the process.</li>
</ul>
<p>If any Record Sets are available a prompt will appear asking if the Catalog Numbers will be entered or taken from the Record Set. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Type the Catalog Numbers into the text dialog with each number separated by a comma.</li>
  <li>or Select a Record Set. (This can also be accomplished by dragging and dropping the Record Set on the Information Request in the Sidebar rather than first clicking on the Information Request).</li>
</ul>
<p>The preparations from the Catalog Numbers or Record Set will appear in the Information Request form. </p>
<p>An important feature of the Information Request is the <em>Send Email on Save</em> button. When the Save button is clicked Specify will pop-up an email dialog. If the Agent record includes an email the address will automatically be included in the pop-up. If the local <a href="email.html">email</a> account is not set up properly the email will not be sent.</p>
<p>Information Requests are not included in the Specify Schema, are not saved in the database and are not searchable. Saved Information Requests are listed on the Interactions Sidebar. To delete an Information Requests simply drag and drop it into the trash can on the Sidebar. There will be record of deleted Information Requests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style3">Borrows</p>
<p class="style2">Specimens that are on on loan from another collection can be tracked in Specify by creating a Borrow. Borrows never become part of your collection and therefore the forms and data will not be entered into any Collection Object fields or related fields. Borrows must be given an Invoice Number. </p>
<p class="style2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style3">Exchange In / Exchange Out</p>
<p class="style2">The Exchange In / Exchange Out feature of Specify 6 is meant to provide a general description of the materials being exchanged, it is not meant to give an itemized list of exchange items. The Agent sending the exchange and the agent cataloging the exchange are the only fields that are required.</p>
