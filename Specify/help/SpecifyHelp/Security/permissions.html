<h2>Adding Users and Setting Permissions</h2>
<p>Specify includes a highly flexible Security module that allows a system administrator to add users, then limit their operations within and access to the various tables and tools within Specify. These are essentially the User Permissions.</p>
<p>To access the Security tool click <em>System &gt; Collection Setup &gt; Security Tools</em>.</p>
<p>Users are added to Specify based on their Institution Level and User Group.</p>
<h4>Institution Levels</h4>
<p>Specify mirrors the common levels of heirarchy within institutions. This hierarchy is viewed in an Institution Tree on the left side of the Security window.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Institution</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Division</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Discipline</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Collection</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Users</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>At this time users are added at the Collection and Discipline levels only. The lowest level, Collection, can access  data within a specific Collection (Wet Collection, Teaching Collection). Specify opens in a collection, or at a Collection level; therefore users added to only one Collection can not access other collections. Collections themselves are held within a Discipline (Ichthyology). Users added at the Discipline level can access all Collections within a Discipline. </p>
<p>Users can belong to more than one Instituion Level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Adding Institutional Levels</strong></p>
 <p>If the desired Institutional level is not present in the Institution Tree it can be added in the System Configuration module by choosing System &gt; Collection Setup &gt; Configuration and following the instructions for <a href="../../Configuration/institution_hierarcy.html">Adding Institutional Levels</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <h4><strong>User Groups</strong></h4>
 <p>Specify adds users to an existing user group. The groups themselves were established according to their access to data and tools within Specify and have a default set of priviledges. Users entered into the group acquire the default priviledges. In a later version of Specify the default priviledges will have the ability to be edited per the individual user as well as per user group.</p>
<ul>
   <li><strong>Guest</strong> users can  view the data within a Collection or Discipline only.</li>
   <li><strong>Limited Access</strong> can view and edit most tables but can not access all the Specify modules such as trees.</li>
   <li><strong>Full Access </strong>users require access the tools for inputing and editing data as well as most modules within Specify, but may access the security module for adding users and setting permissions.</li>
  <li><strong>Manager</strong> can add users and give permissions as well as access and edit all tables and tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>Users can be added to more than one group within different Disciplines, but should not be added to both a Discipline and Collection within the same Discipline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <h4><a name="add_user" id="add_user"></a>Adding Users</h4>
<p>Right-click on the  appropriate Group type within the applicable Institution level to add a user to a group. A dialog will appear to either add a new user or existing user. </p>
 <p><u>Existing User</u></p>
 <p>This is the beauty of the implementing the Institution Heirarchy at the Security level; users can be given unique permissions to different collections without needing more than one password. Simply choose a User from the ensueing dialog to add them.</p>
<p><u>New User</u></p>
 <p>Users are added in the Specify User dialog. </p>
 <ul>
   <li><strong>Name</strong> refers to the username the user will use to login to Specify. Once the username is saved it may not be edited.</li>
   <li><strong>Password</strong> is the password the user will use to login to Specify. Passwords can be edited at a later date either in Security Tools or by choosing <em>Help &gt; Change Password</em>.</li>
   <li><strong>Email </strong></li>
   <li><strong>Agent</strong> refers to the data in the Agent table. All users must be Agents. If the user already exists within the table  type the first few letters in the name and either type the down-arrow key.</li>
   <li><strong>Key</strong> refers to the encrypted Master Username and Password. Simply fill in all the information within the dialog and click the <em>Generate New Key</em> button. The key can not be created without the Name and Password information. The key is stored locally and will therefore need to be given to the user and entered by the user at the time of their first login to Specify. For more information regarding this key please refer to <a href="../Security/security.html">Security</a>.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <h3><strong><u><a name="set_permissions" id="set_permissions"></a> Permissions</u></strong></h3>
 <h4>User Permissions</h4>
<p>Specify 6.0 grants default permissions to each User Group within Specify. These permissions are then passed down to each User within the Group. The permissions for the individual user can either be left unchanged and therefore remain exactly like the Group, or be edited for that user. When editing permissions for individual users permissions for tables and tools can be added, but not removed. </p>
<h4>Group Permissions</h4>
<p>Permissions can be removed and added at the Group level, but keep in mind that Specify will update all the Users in the group with the changed permissions. Changing permissions for a Group will only affect that Group's Collection. </p>
<h4>Setting Permissions</h4>
<p>Click on a User or Group to view both their User information and Permissions in the work space. The Permissions open in the bottom half of the work space and include a tab with three permission categories:</p>
<ul>
   <li><strong>Tools</strong> refer to anything used to manipulate data within Specify. </br><br /><br />
 
Click on a Tool in the list to display the options for the permissions. Configuration, Data Entry, Information Request, Interactions, Plugins, Record Sets, Reports, Security Tools, Simple Search, Statistics have these permissions:</br></br><br />
<ul>
  <li><strong>View</strong> allows a user to view data within a tool. </li>
  <li><strong>Add</strong> allows a user to add  a record within the context of the tool.</li>
  <li><strong>Modify</strong> allows users to edit data within the context of the tool.</li>
  <li><strong>Delete</strong> allows users to delete data within the context of the tool.</li>
</ul>
</br></br><br />
Backup and Restore, Query, Resource Import and Export, Schema Configuration, WorkBench and WorkBench Schema Configurationand allow tools to be enabled only.
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Tables </strong>refers to each of the tables in Specify.</br>
    Permissions can be set for each individual table within the Specify schema.<br />
    <br />
 
Click on a Table in the list to display the options for the permissions:</br></br><br />
<ul>
  <li><strong>View</strong> allows a user to view table data. </li>
  <li><strong>Add</strong> allows a user to add  a record.</li>
  <li><strong>Modify</strong> allows users to edit table data within a record.</li>
  <li><strong>Delete</strong> allows users to delete table data within a record.</li></br>
</ul>
  <li><strong>Preferences</strong> lists the modules in the actual Preferences module.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Permissions and how it affects the Specify Application </strong></p>
 <p>When Specify starts up it checks the user permissions and loads various Specify tools accordingly. Therefore, users that are not given permission to use modules in Specify will not see the corresponding buttons that connect users to that module. For instance, users that are not given permission to edit trees will not have a tree button on the task bar or have the ability to add the tree button in the user preferences tool.</p>
 <p>Similarly, users that are not given permission to delete or add data  will not see the add or delete buttons. </p>
 <p>It is extremely important to note that even though  permissions are listed seperately for each table and tool, many of these affect each other and should have similar settings. For instance, for a user to have access to a Collection Object form for data entry purposes the user will need to have View, Add and possibly Modify priviledges for ALL the tables on the Collection Object form (Collection Object, Determinations, Collecting Event, Taxon, Perparations, Collection Object Attribute, Collectors and Collection Object Attachments) PLUS the Form tool itself. For instance, in this example if permissions was not given for a user to Add or Modify the Prepartions table the user would not be provided with the <img src="../../images/add.png" width="16" height="16" /> (add) or <img src="../../images/delete.png" width="16" height="16" /> (delete) button on the Preparations sub form. For this reason a good practice may be to set the same level of permissions for all the Tables within a tool. An example of the Tables for each tool follows. </p>
 <p>Data Entry</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A good approach to setting permissions may be to decide what Tables and Tools a particular user should not have access to and then change the permissions accordingly. </p>
