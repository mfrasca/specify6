<h2>Specify Setup</h2>
<p>Specify's flexible design can accomodate a single user with a single collection or multiple collections representing multiple disciplines within an institution - all sharing the same database. This is accomplished by creating relationships among collection data as well as modeling how collections are organized within institutions themselves and then configuring components within Specify specifically for each institutional level. </p>
<p>What this means for you, the  user, is that Specify 6 can be configured to work congruently with existing collection management procedures, but it requires a thoughtful setup process. This process may vary depending on how Specify was installed. If you were a Specify 5 user and have worked with the Specify staff to convert your data, many of the setup steps will have been performed for you. It is still recommended that you read the help sections for each of the modules to better understand how each module can be utilized for your specific needs. </p>
<p>System Adminstrators that have run the Specify Setup Wizard will have one of each of the institutional levels (institution, division, discipline, collection and user). Most administrators will need to  add more to each level depending on the number of collections within the division that will share a database. </p>
<p><a href="../Configuration/institution_hierarchy.html">Add collections, disciplines and divisions</a> in the <em>System Configuration at System &gt; System Setup &gt; Configuration</em>.</p>
<p>Once these institutional levels are configured users can be added to each of the collections. Specify also offers an extensive permission system which controls the access each user is given to both data and tools within Specify.</p>
<p><a href="../Security/permissions.html">Add users and set user permissions</a> using the Security tools found at <em>System &gt; System Setup &gt; Security Tools</em>.</p>
<p>Once the institutional levels, users and permissions are complete, information specific to each discipline can be configured. </p>
<p>The Wizard created trees for Taxon, Geography, Storage, Lithostratigraphy and Chronostratigraphy (if applicable). The ranks in the trees as well as the Enforced ranks and Full Name configuration were also created. It is recommended that users check these in the <a href="../Trees/editing_tree_def.html">Tree D</a><a href="../Trees/editing_tree_def.html">efinitions</a> as once data is entered the Full Name can not be changed. Tree Definitions are found by clicking the <img src="../../images/Tree-32x32.png" width="20" height="20" /> <em>Tree</em> button on the Tab Bar, then clicking the appropriate <em>Tree Definition</em> button on the Side Bar.</p>
<p><a href="../SchemaConfig/schema_config.html">Editing the schema</a> allows users to customize fields and tables within Specify for each of the Disciplines. The Schema Configuration tool, found at <em>System &gt; Schema Configuration</em>, lists all the Tables and Fields within Specify along with their relationships and allows a variety of schema changes, such as hiding fields that are not used, changing captions, requiring fields and changing table and <a href="../Intro/number_formats.html">format fields</a> as well as table aggregation. </p>
<p><a href="../Intro/number_formats.html"></a>A variety of <a href="../PickList/system_picklist.html">System Pick Lists</a> exist within the Specify form system. These can be edited in a System Configuration module, found at <em>System &gt; System Setup &gt; Configuration</em> along with the <a href="../Configuration/prep_type.html">Preparation Type Pick List</a>.</p>
