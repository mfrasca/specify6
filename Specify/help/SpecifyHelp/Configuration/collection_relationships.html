<h2>Configure Collection Relationships</h2>
<p>New in Specify 6.3! Specimens are often found on, in, or among each other. Collections which track this type of information require a way to show  'relationship' data. Specify offers several solutions. Please read the document .... to discover which solution is right for your collection and ensure that your data is entered correctly for your specific needs. </p>
<p>This documentation is meant only to explain the tools within Specify, for a more indepth explanation of relationships and containers and how they interact in Specify please refer to the document .....</p>
<p>All of these solutions require changes to the default forms in Specify. Please contact Specify at <a href=
      "mailto:specify@ku.edu">specify@ku.edu</a> to request new forms.</p>
<h3>Configure Collection Relationships</h3>
<p>Choose <em>System &gt; Configure Collection Relationships</em> to open the tool.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This tool allows two collections to create a relationship in which there is a source collection and a destination collection. The source collection must always include collection objects. The source collection object forms will include a field for choosing the destination information. This may be either another collection object from an existing collection or taxonomic name from a taxonomic tree.</p>
  <p>A single source may relate to either a single destination or many destinations within a collection.</p>
  <p>The Destination collection object form does not offer the capacity for choosing a collection object or taxonomic name from the source collection. </p>
  <p>Types of Relationships:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Object Relationship </li>
    <li>Host Taxon ID </li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Object Relationship</strong> refers to two collections with collection objects in which a source collection object relates to one or many destination collection objects.</p>
    <p><strong>Host Taxon ID</strong> refers to the field name in which a source collection object relates to a destination taxonomic name. The taxonomic name is taken from a destination collection which exists merely for the purpose of offering a taxonomic tree. It is not necessary for the destination collection to include collection objects. </p>

<h4><u>Source Forms</u></h4>

  <p>The source collection object form must be edited to include the necessary fields to show these relationships. </p>
