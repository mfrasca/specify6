/**
 * Interface to the factory for creating View (Form) Based Dialogs/Frame or Search dialogs.<br>
 * These  dialogs are special in that a single name references a detailed discription of what the dialog is to look like,
 * what form should be used, and whether it can be editable.<BR>BR>
 *
 * For the search dialogs, the definition contains information about how tro search both in JDBC (straigh SQL) or
 * by using Hibernate. Note: The applicaiton is currently set upto have just one factory and it must be "set" into
 * the UIRegistry before it can be used by everyone.<br><BR>
 *
 * There are not rules for who creates the factory or when the factory should created. Currently, the edu.ku.brc.ui.db
 * package contains refernce implementations of Dialogs/Frame created by the "createDisplay" methods and these can be
 * used as is. Anyone creating their own factory must create there own "createSearchDialog" implementation.
