<p>Some databases converted from Specify 5 to Specify 6 have an issue with the placement of synonymized names in the Taxon Tree.  
This function creates a report which identifies species-level synonyms which may need attention depending on whether you actively 
curate species synonyms in your Taxon Tree.  If your collection data were not migrated from Specify 5 to 6, this situation does not 
apply to you there is no need to run this report.
</p>
<p>
The analysis produces a report about the names of any species used as synonyms, i.e. placed in synonymy in your Taxon Tree, 
which as a result of a Specify 5-to-6 conversion may have been parented incorrectly or incompletely.  
This analysis only applies to species-level names and only to synonyms.  The conversion did not change any Specify 5 determinations of collection objects, 
or modify any previously made synonymization actions in Specify 5. This is a relatively minor placement issue of where a species-level 
synonym displays in the Taxon tree, i.e. which genus is the parent of a synonymized species.  For most collections this display issue 
with synonyms will be of little consequence, but we describe it below in case you actively manage synonym entries using your Taxon Tree 
as a classification/authority file resource for all names, accepted and synonymized.
</p>
<p>
Currently in Specify 6, when species are synonymized, they appear where they should be located Ð under the original genus entry.  
The names appear in blue text indicating they have been synonymized to some other taxon.  Moving a mouse pointer over them will 
pop-up the name of that accepted taxon.  As the result of a Specify 5-6 conversion some synonyms will appear to be parented by the 
genus belonging to the accepted species name.  In some cases species-level synonyms will not have a parent at the genus level in the 
Specify 6 tree, such as if the original genus was deleted in Specify 5.
</p>
<p>
Because Specify 5 stored synonyms differently than Specify 6, there was no unambiguous way to migrate some species synonym names from 
5 to 6 so that they would be parented and displayed correctly. This does not cause any problems for searches or queries, or for the 
integrity of accepted Taxon Names or Collection Object determinations Ð all of those all migrated from 5-to-6 correctly and remain accurate.
</p>
<p>
The report produced by this analysis shows the full name of any species-level "orphaned" synonyms which are not correctly parented 
in the Specify 6 Taxon tree (under the original genus).  It shows the name of the "Orphan Synonym" and its current parent genus and 
the family of the current genus.  It then shows the name of the "Proposed Genus" and "Proposed Family" for the re-parenting of the 
synonymized species binomial.  Note, if the proposed genus no longer exists in the Specify 6 Taxon Tree (likely it was deleted by a 
user in Specify 5) the report indicates "Synonym Placeholder" for the Proposed Genus and Family.  
</p>
<p>
If the batch repair function is run after viewing this report, all the names indicated in the report will be moved to the Proposed parent.  
The repair function does not insert genera into families where they may belong.  If a single genera matiching the original parent is found in 
your taxon tree already, Specify will move the orphan synonym to that genera.  Where a matching genera was found, the proposed parent and family 
will say the matching genus and family.  Where a matching original parent was not found or multiple were found, the Proposed Parent is "Synonym Placeholder".  
The orphan synonym will be moved to a new, "placeholder" branch rooted at the base of your tree with "Synonym Placeholder" shown as taxon 
names all the way down the tree to the family level. For these species, the repair function makes an entry for the Proposed Genus, in the Synonym Placeholder 
branch of the tree.  When complete, the repair function adds the proposed genera from orphaned synonyms (without proposed parents or 
Families indicated in the report) in your database in that single branch of your Taxon Tree.  It is left to the user to decide which generic names, 
if any, are worth saving and re-parenting (through drag-and-drop moves) to actual families in the Taxon tree.  This report also indicates which 
orphaned synonyms, if any, in your Taxon Tree have been determined to a collection object.
