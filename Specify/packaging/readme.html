  <li>1.  The Specify Wizard has been updated to enable the creation of a Specify database and Master user so that a  database on a server or other machine 

not running the Wizard can be set up, and with a MySQL script available from the web site, INNOdb need not be set as the default setting for all databases 

on the server, only the Specify database is set up as INNOdb.
